# PGM Image Processor 

Please note, either use the images in the root dir or move the image from Assignment Resouces folder to root and make PGM.

To run the program:
- type "make" in the terminal then "./findcomp" with the respective command line arguments

To run the unit tests:

   - Represents individual connected components
   - Stores pixel coordinates and component metadata
   - Used by PGMimageProcessor for component tracking

3. **driver.cpp** 
   - Example main program demonstrating functionality
   - Shows basic usage of the PGMimageProcessor class

4. **catch.hpp**
   - Catch2 testing framework header
   - Used for unit tests (not required for main program)

5. **test_driver.cpp**
   - Comprehensive unit tests for all functionality
   - Tests image processing and component analysis
